- ✅ **Dashboard (`index.html`)**: The central control hub.
- ✅ **Servers (`servers.html`)**: For multi-server management.
- ✅ **Players (`players.html`)**: For player administration.
- ✅ **Console (`console.html`)**: A full-screen terminal.
- ✅ **Logs (`logs.html`)**: An advanced log viewer and analyzer.
- ✅ **Performance (`performance.html`)**: Real-time stats and graphs.
- ✅ **Files (`files.html`)**: A complete file manager and editor.
- ✅ **Backups (`backups.html`)**: A robust backup and restore system.
